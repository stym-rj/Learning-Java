// there are 3 types of inheritance in java.
// 1. Single Inheritance
// 2. Multilevel Inheritance
// 3. Hierarchial Inheritance.
// MultiLevel and Hybrid type of Inheritance does not exists in java because of function ambiguity. Thats why java doesnot supports these inheritances.
// for MultiLevel or Hybrid type of Inheritance, java uses a concept called as INTERFACES.
